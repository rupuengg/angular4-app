# Setting up a new Angular 4 application
I will start from the beginning. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine, follow the instructions here: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/). When that is done run .node -v to test that evverything is up to date. And just in case test so you have the latset version of npm; .npm -v otherwise do: .npm install npm -g.

Now we are ready to install angular and its packages on your computer:
```
$npm install -g @angular/cli
```
We are using /cli — due to it being very simple when creating, mananging and building, it automatically creates new projects and some useful commands for continue building in the app. Its easier than to having to do everything manually.

Then create a new project.
```
$ng new my_new_project
$cd my_new_project
```

And then to run the server: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
